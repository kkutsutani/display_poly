TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.397 ns between U1/v_count_reg_reg[5]/C (clocked by CLK) and RGB_reg[9]/D (clocked by CLK). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.403 ns between U1/v_count_reg_reg[5]/C (clocked by CLK) and RGB_reg[10]/D (clocked by CLK). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
